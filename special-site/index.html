            so it was never the reason that you didnt had any value for me i had some reasons which were kind of reasons 
            <ul>
              <li>i was terminally ill i had jaundice and for about month i couldnt keep awake myself for more that 2 hours together phone was completely banned but it was my mistake that didnt even told you abut this</li>
              <li>as you know there had been a death of a close family member about a few months ago before i ghosted you but i dont know how to say that i lost another one of my close family memeber to covid whome i was very close to more over was even living with when this all happened</li>
              <li>due to this i started staying wake till 6 am with those sleepless nights just thinking about useless things wrong with me in the morning and therefore could'nt focus on anything and started staying depressed and would have anxiety attacks over little things and as a very obvious result grades dropped to almost failing scores and by that  mean i almost got failed and my parents as usual who were also going through all this banned my devices and wanted me to come back on track which was a difficult phase for all of us</li>
            </ul>
            <p> i mean i could go keep making excuses but end of the day they are all excuses. The truth of the matter was it would only take about a minute to tell you and send a HI message but i failed to do so and i am really regretfull of that discion till date after almost an year of this all happening</p>
        </p>

      <div class="container-fluid my-4 py-5">
        <h3 class="text-center">Finally ending</h3>
        <p>i know what i did was very wrong and you are porbably thinking ki "aa gayi iski sad dukhad story sympathy ke leye" OR "this dosent make sense at all and all you had to do was atleast tell or atleast just relpy to me properly" OR "that you had spend me so much time and effort and when it cam my turn i could'nt even do a little".You really devoted yourself to the last moment in the hopes that you can save what we had and all i did was look toward my problems and being self centered at all the moments you are probably right</p>
        <p>you must be going like kya publicity stunt hai yeh but what i really want is to make right of what i did wrong which is probably impossible i just want to say that it is the thing i am most ashamed of in my life and I am soory for hurting you i hate myself for not even thinking once during that what you would be going through and like a selfish person jest kept on thinking about myself</p>
        <p>I know how much Friendship and trust meant to you which i breached completely and have no right to even think about you ever again but what i have come to realize is it is in the past and nothing i do now can change or cover it up so all i want to say soory for all the things you had to go through beacuse of me and thanks for being there for me even after months of me not paying attention to you</p>
        <p>May god bless you witl goo fortune and a smooth life and atlest a better Friend than me who is not a </p>
